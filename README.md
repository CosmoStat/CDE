This repository contains the modified CLASS code that we have used to run our analysis for our tomographic coupled dark energy (CDE) model (see [Goh, Gómez-Valent, Pettorino and Kilbinger (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13588)). It is an extension of the one employed for a constant coupling strength in [Gómez-Valent, Pettorino and Amendola (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00610) and [Gómez-Valent, Zheng, Amendola, Wetterich and Pettorino (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14487).

We have included the version with a 3-bin parameterisation, with bin edges z={0,100,1000}. 

We have also included a notebook to reproduce Figures 2,3 and 12 of our paper.
